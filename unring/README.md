Gibbs‐ringing artifact removal based on local subvoxel‐shifts.
Magnetic resonance in medicine, 76(5), 1574-1581.

**Setup**

Add `unring.py` to you `PATH`.

Depends on MATLAB: contains a compiled matlab implementation for working with nrrd files.

Compatible with 64 bit Linux due to reliance on compiled code. Please contact [Ning, Lipeng, Ph.D](mailto:lning@bwh.harvard.edu) or 	[Rathi, Yogesh, Ph.D](mailto:YOGESH@bwh.harvard.edu) if you need code for other platforms.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04, python 2.7, MATLAB R2014a.
